## `resource`
The `resource` field denotes the unique identifier of the database object being changed. The underlying database field varys by action, and the mapping is provided in the [actions table](#action).

## `actions`
When a change is made to a database model, a single, timestamped **action** is generated with all of the associated [deltas](#deltas) contained within.
:::info
Generally, the length of this field will be 1; however in the event your service is unable to accept webhooks, this field will accumulate all actions that have occurred since the last successful webhook. In this event, the `actions` field is pre-sorted from the earliest to latest.
:::

### `action`
The `action` field describes what kind of webhook is being emitted. Below is a list of the possible actions and their presecribed function, along with any other relevant information.

| Action                  | `resource` Field                         | Function                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `member_created_action` | [`Member.id`](../Models/member#memberid) | Emitted when a user is created  |
| `member_changed_action` | [`Member.id`](../Models/member#memberid) | Emitted when a user is modified |

More webhooks will be added throughout various testing phases to facilitate GDPR deletion requests, events, and oter necessary functionality.

### `authority`
The `authority` field simply denotes the organization or service responsible for the actions enclosed in the webhook.

### `deltas`
A **delta** simply represents a change in a single field's value, and thus includes the previous and new value. Multiple deltas can be bundled up into an [action](#actions) if multiple fields are changed together.

In webhooks that report the *creation* of a model, the `before` field will be set to `null`.

In webhooks that report the *deletion* of a model, the `after` field will be set to `null`.
